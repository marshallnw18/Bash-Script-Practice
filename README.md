# Bash Script Practice
The bash scripts in this repository are practice scripts I've completed throughout the process of teaching myself Linux (centOS7/Ubuntu) sever administation!

## Web Server List Iteration
This script shows off the basics of:
- non-exported variable assignments
- array lists
- iteration with a For loop 
within a bash shell. The premise is to iterate through a pre-defined array list of webservers and display the name of each server as it is processed.
